This is a project I created to test out creating generic 
makefiles, following the instructions from:
http://www.puxan.com/web/howto-write-generic-makefiles/

Generic makefiles can automatically detect source files based on 
file extensions (e.g. *.cpp) so that file names don't need to be hardcoded 
in the makefile.
